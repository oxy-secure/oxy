On the server:
oxy keygen > server_key   # This will create the host key
oxy keygen server_key     # This will print the public key of the host key

On the client:
oxy keygen > client_key   # Creates the key
oxy keygen client_key     # Prints the public key

On the server:

Press F10 to get to an interactive command prompt from the client. You can start portforwards and transfer files from this prompt.

Press F12 to exit out of the client.

Here are some things you can do at the metacommand prompt:

oxy> download /tmp/foo /tmp/bar          # Download remote file /tmp/foo to local file /tmp/bar
oxy> L 127.0.0.1:5900 127.0.0.1:5901     # Open a local portforward that connects to 127.0.0.1:5901 on the remote side.
oxy> tun tun0 tun1                       # Connect tunnel devices local(tun0) and remote(tun1) together.
                                         # Use "sudo ip tuntap add mode tun user yourname" to create the devices with
                                         # appropriate permissions from before hand, obviating the need to run Oxy as root on either side.
